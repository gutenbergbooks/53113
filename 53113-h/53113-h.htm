<p class='c006'>These myths and tales are the free translations of texts recorded in
the dialect of the White Mountain Apache. The texts themselves with
word for word translations follow as Part IV of the volume. They were
recorded, with one exception, during the winter of 1910 as a part of the
studies made in the Southwest under the yearly grant of Mr. Archer M.
Huntington. The creation myth, secured from Noze, differs in important
incidents from the versions given above from the San Carlos as well as
from versions secured from other White Mountain Apache. It should
not be assumed that these differences are tribal, it is more probable that
they are individual, since forms from the San Carlos and Navajo are closely
similar to each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>The greater number of the remaining narratives were secured from the
father of Frank Crockett, the interpreter employed. Several of these are
ceremonial and religious in their character and probably would not have
been given except for the son's influence. Two of these were later secured
from San Carlos informants in more extended form but highly corroborative
in their general agreement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The main purpose in recording these narratives was to secure sufficient
and varied connected texts in the dialect of the White Mountain Apache.
As a collection of mythology and folklore it is probably far from complete.
It is assumed, however, to be fairly representative.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>Creation Myth.</span><a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There were many houses there. A maiden went from the settlement to
the top of a high mountain<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and came where the rays of the rising Sun first
strike. She raised her skirt and the “breath” of the Sun entered her.
She went up the mountain four mornings, and four times the breath of the
Sun penetrated her. This girl who had never been married became pregnant
and the people were making remarks about it.</p>

<p class='c000'>She went up the mountain on four successive days and four days after
that, eight days altogether, she gave birth to a child. Four days later,
the child stood on its feet. His fingers and toes were webbed and he had
neither eyebrows nor eyelashes and the hairs on his head were scattered,
one in a place. His ears were round with only the openings. Everyone
said he did not look like a man. After four more days he walked well
and played with the other children.</p>

<p class='c000'>His mother went again to the east and lay down under a place where
water was dripping. The water fell into her as it dripped from the hanging
algæ. She did this four times and became pregnant. After four days
they all saw that her abdomen was enlarged and when she had been in that
condition four days, eight days in all, she gave birth to another child.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
When it was four days old it stood up and was able to walk well. Its
appearance was like that of the first child. It had webbed hands and feet
and was without hair. It had round ears with holes only. The children
walked about together, the head of one being higher than that of the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>The people were asking, “Whose children are these going about?”
They wanted to know who would make them like human beings. “Who are
the kin of the woman whose children are going about among us?” The
mother had a sister who wondered why the people were saying these things,
for the boys had a father who lived a long way off.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boys were eight days old and big enough to run about and were
becoming intelligent. They asked their mother where their father was
living. “Why do you ask?” she said. “You cannot go to him.” “Why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>do you say that? Why do you hide our father from us?” the boys asked.
“Well, do you really want to go where your father lives?” she asked them.
“Why do you suppose we are asking?” the boys replied. “We will go
where our father lives.” Their mother told them that they were talking
foolishly, that the distance was great, and that they would not be able to go.
The boys insisted but were again discouraged by their mother. They
finally said that it must be they had no father if they could not go to him.
The mother then consented and said they three would go to the top of a
great mountain. She cut a supply of meat and after four days, when it
was near dawn, they started. They came to the top of the mountain when
it was day and stood there facing the Sun. The woman stood between the
boys holding them by the hand. When the sun was rising she said: “Look,
your father is rising. Observe well. His breath streams out from four
sides. Go towards the streaming out of his breath. There are dangerous
things living in the east. What have you to go with?” She had a brown
fly and she gave it to the boys, that it might sit by their ears. The fly was
to show them the way and tell them where the dangerous ones lived.</p>

<p class='c000'>She told them they were to start at midday. They remained there
until the sun reached the sky hole.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a> They then went four times around the
trees on top of the mountain. The woman started home and the boys
set out on their journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boys went toward the east but the Sun was going in the opposite
direction.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> The boys sat down and cried. A Raven, spreading out his
wings, alighted nearby and asked the boys why they were crying. The
boys replied that their father lived over there and that they were going to
visit him. The Raven asked if they were carrying anything in the way of
food with them. They replied that they had some meat. The Raven said
they might ride on his back if they would give him some of the meat. The
fly told them it would be all right to ride on the Raven, that the Raven
could see half the way and that there someone was living who knew the
remainder of the way. They were told by the Raven to break up the meat
and put the pieces in his mouth, that two of the parcels would sustain him
until he finished the journey as far as he knew the way. They were directed
to get on the Raven's back. The Raven began by flying near the ground,
then went higher and higher, circling around. A hot rain fell but the
Raven covered them with his wings. They kept putting the meat into the
Raven's mouth. When they had fed the Raven two pieces of the meat
they passed through a cloud where the large Eagle lived. The Raven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>told them that that one (the Eagle) would now take them, that he knew all
the places because he saw everything upon the earth; that he himself would
go back.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Eagle asked them where they were going, saying that he lived in a
dangerous place. The boys indicated the direction they were going, saying
they had been told their father lived there. Eagle said it was true their
father lived at that place and asked if they had heard about his house.
The boys replied that their mother had told them that the Sun was their
father and that he lived over there. Because she had told them this they
were on their way to see him. Eagle asked them by what means they
intended to go, saying even he was in danger from the Sun. The fly staying
by the ear of one of the boys flew away and soon returned with the statement
that the dangerous places did exist and that Eagle, with whom they were
sitting, was the one who knew and was in control of these dangerous places.
Before the house of the Sun was ice, interlocked like fallen timber. Eagle
addressed the boys, asking if they had with them anything from the earth,
meaning meat. They replied that they had and each of the boys took some
from his pocket. Eagle asked for some of it, which when it was given him
he ate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Eagle then said they would set out, for he knew the trail. He requested
them to put meat in his mouth as he flew with them, indicating the amount
which would be sufficient, for the trail. When they were seated on the Eagle
he started down with them, circling around as he flew. A storm of hail
fell on them, the hailstones being large with thirty-two points.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a> The eagle
protected the boys by covering them with his wings which were rolled back
over them. When they had passed through the storm Eagle asked that
meat be put in his mouth. When he had been fed he flew away with
the boys and went through a hole which was there for him. When he came
to the trail he alighted and pointing out the path told them that it led to
the house of the Sun.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> He said that he himself would now turn back home.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boys went forward until they crossed a shallow valley beyond which
was the house, which had projections running out in four directions. When
they walked with their eyes closed the house went out of sight, but when
they opened their eyes the house settled down again. It did this four times
and then it stood firmly. The two boys walked on and coming to the house,
stood in front of the entrance. An old woman who was the wife of the
Sun sat there.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>She advised them to go on wherever they were intending to go, since a
person of mean disposition was soon to arrive. The woman who spoke to
them was really handsome but she sat there in the form of an old woman.
The boys replied that they had been told that their father lived there, and
that they had started to come that morning. The woman replied that she
did not know who their father was. The boys said that the Sun was their
father and they had come to visit him. The woman then asked who had
told them that the Sun was their father. They said their mother had told
them so. The woman told them that their father would soon return and
asked them to be seated on a chair she indicated. When they were seated,
the chair kept whirling around with them. When the chair would lift up
the woman would make it come down again. When the woman saw the
chair come down again she announced herself as nearly convinced they had
spoken the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Saying that the Sun was now coming close, she took four silk blankets<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
of different colors which had been sewed together projecting in four directions
and rolled the boys up in them. She put them into an inside room.
They heard the Sun come back and heard him speak. “Old woman, where
are the two men who came here?” he asked. The woman replied: “I
have not seen anyone. No one has been here.” “You say there is no one.
They must have come, for here are their tracks,” the Sun replied. “You
must have been cohabiting with someone else. You say you travel over
this broad earth and that you do not visit anyone. You must have been
deceiving me about it for two men came in from that trail saying they are
your children,” his wife said. The Sun asked that they be brought in,
and the woman opened the door, brought in the roll of blankets, and threw
it down. The Sun shook the blankets and two men stood up. The Sun
spoke: “Hesh, do you consider these to be my children? They do not
look like me.” He stood by them and repeated his question, calling attention
to their webbed hands and feet and their round ears. “Are you really
my children?” he asked them. “Who is called the Sun, I wonder?” the
youngest of the boys said, and water fell from his eyes. “Well, maybe you
are my children. Sit here and wait,” the Sun said. Their fly looked
around and reported that the man was their father. After examining the
room everywhere, the inner corners, the windows, and door, the fly told
them that ordeals were being prepared for them. He said that soon a
blazing sky would be arranged, into which they would be thrown. The
fly looked around for downy feathers which he gave the boys.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Sun had finished eating he asked that those who said they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>the Sun's children should be brought in. He threw them into the place of
danger. He pushed them in with lightning which had sharp spines. They
turned into downy feathers and stood in front of him again. “It is true,”
the Sun said. He threw them in four times, pushing them down. Each
time they turned into feathers and came back in front of the Sun as before.
The Sun then said he was convinced that they were his children. His
wife said: “They told you they were your children, but you have treated
them badly.” The Sun replied: “They certainly are my children but I
did not believe it before.” The Sun asked his wife to prepare a sweatlodge
as soon as they had eaten.</p>

<p class='c000'>She made a sweatlodge covered with a blue blanket on one side, a black
one on another side, a white one on another side, and a yellow one on another
side. His wife had the stones heated red hot, like red hot iron. They
three went right in, but the Sun only came out again. When the bath had
been heated the fourth time the boys were as if they had been boiled. He
pushed back the skin which was between their fingers and toes. He fixed
for them their lower leg muscles, their knees, their thighs, their biceps,
their elbows, and their lower arms. He made the hair of their heads come
to their hips, twisting it off at that length. He made their ears, their
eyelashes, and their eyebrows, their noses, their mouths, and their faces.
He fixed every part of their bodies as it should be. The Sun went out of
the bath with the boys and sat with them on the seat where his wife usually
sat. They were just like men.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a> When the wife of the Sun came and stood
in front of them she looked at them closely, but could not distinguish one
from the other. “Move, husband,” she said. The one sitting in the
middle moved himself. “You told me you had not been with any woman
but you fooled me. These are your children. You must have a wife.
Go home with them,” the woman said.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sun spoke to his wife, saying that these were his children but that
if he went away with them to the earth she would be lonesome. Only
today there was a good sunset. “Just now when you said 'no' your eye
winked,” he said to her. “I am jealous of what is far away,” she said.
The Sun said he would not go, but would talk to his children.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My boys, shall I give you names?” “Yes, it is not well to be without
names,” they replied. Then the Sun said he would name them. He told
the older his name would be Naiyenezgani and that he must behave well.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>He told the other one that he would be named Tobatc'istcini. “When you
are upon the earth you will be called so and you will tell them that your
father named you that. You shall say, 'He made my name Naiyenezgani.'
But you, 'Tobatc'istcini he made my name,' you must tell them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sun then asked them for what they had come. They told him they
had come for his horse, his saddle, his bridle, his halter, his rope, and his
saddle blanket. The Sun asked who had told them he had such property.
The older one replied that their mother had told them what property he had
and had told them that she would be happy if they brought it back to the
earth. She said that he (the Sun) would also be happy. The Sun replied
that he had no property, no horse, saddle, bridle, halter, rope, or saddle
blanket. The fly had told them that the Sun had these, but he looked
around again and reported that the Sun had them close by.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us go over there,” one of them proposed. They went to a fenced
enclosure and entered through a gate. The yard was so full of black bears
that the mass of their moving backs occupied the entire space. “Which
of those are my horses?” the Sun asked. “They are fearful animals,” the
boys replied. “These are my horses,” the Sun insisted and mounted one
of them and rode around on it. The fly informed the boys that they were
being deceived. The Sun proposed that they should go in another direction
to another enclosure. Inside this yard were white-tail deer, mule
deer, elk, and mountain-sheep. The Sun announced that these were his
horses and told the boys to choose any one they liked and catch it. “Which
is the largest?” he asked them. “These are not horses,” the boys replied,
“they are named deer. We asked you for horses.” The Sun insisted they
were his horses and that he rode them great distances. “Well, you have
outwitted me. I thought I would succeed in outwitting you, but you have
won.” The younger brother asked the Sun what he was concealing from
them, saying he could find them. The Sun asked them not to say that and
proposed that they look in another place where he had a few horses confined.
They went to the place indicated and found the place filled with antelope,
sheep, goats, and pigs. “Catch any one of these you want,” the Sun
said. “You tend to them here alone,” the boys replied and walked out
leaving the Sun who followed behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>They went to the house and ate a meal. Their fly told them that the
Sun's horses were in the enclosure that had four doors. When they had
finished eating they went to this enclosure which was a house with a roof
having holes in it. It had spikes like irons, sticking up from it. It was
closed and completely dark. “There are horses in there,” the fly told them.
The Sun said, “I told you it was useless.” One of the boys asked that they
might look in. There was a door there which he opened. A little beyond it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>was another door, a little beyond another, and a little beyond that another,
and still beyond that another. They now came to horses in the enclosure
but could not enter. By standing on something they could see through a
hole in the roof. They could not get in between the horses until they were
caused to separate and to open up a passage. The Sun then told them to
catch the horse that they thought was his. The fly sitting by one of their
ears told them they were to catch the horse with a rope which they should
induce the Sun to give them. When the Sun again urged them to catch
the horse without delay, they asked whether they should lead the horse
by the mane or carry him out in their hands. The Sun, with spotted ropes
in his hand, went right through the door which he opened. He gave one of
the ropes to each of the boys, telling them to catch the horses which were
his. The animals were milling around in the enclosure. In the center was
one which was not moving, a sorrel with a small white spot on its forehead.
Its mane reached the ground. When it raised its head one of the boys
started toward it, the horses separating. He threw the rope and caught
the horse which he led back. The Sun then told the other boy to catch a
horse, wanting to know who had told him which horse to catch. There
was a stallion running around the outside of the herd. Its mane reached
the ground; he was acting wild but the fly told them that although he acted
as if he were mean he was really gentle. He directed them to take both these
horses from the Sun. When the other boy started with his rope toward the
stallion he was running around the outside of the herd and coming toward
the boy. When he came close and saw the boy he stopped and then wheeled
back. The boy lassoed it and immediately the horse trotted up to him,
nosing his arm. He led the stallion up beside the sorrel horse which was
a mare. The Sun said: “There they are, ride them, take them with you
to the earth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The boys then asked for the horse trappings for which they had also
come. The Sun said he did not know what they meant by horse trappings.
The younger boy said, “Well, if you do not know what horse trappings are,
do not again put them on these horses in the corral.” The Sun asked who
it was who had made them as smart as he was himself. They replied that
he, the Sun, had made them smart and had made them speak wisely. They
then asked by name for bridle, halter, saddle blanket, and saddle.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Turning
his back to the boys he walked away and opened a door, bidding the boys
enter. They went in and saw saddles lying there with bridles hanging
on the saddle horns. The blankets were lying beneath. Before they went
in the fly flew in and selected two out of all the saddles. One was lying at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>the east and the other at the west. The first was blue and the other yellow.
The fly had returned to one of their ears by the time the Sun said: “There
are those saddles, take the ones you want.” The fly told the boys that the
saddles which looked good really were not, but that they should choose the
blue and yellow ones, indicating them, and the blankets, halters, bridles,
and ropes of similar colors lying by them. These were the Sun's own particular
set of trappings. When the Sun urged them to hurry up each boy
stepped toward the saddle he had chosen. When they did so the saddles
moved of themselves with the blankets and bridles. There was a sound
“gij” of the moving leather and “tsil” as they came to rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sun turned his face away and took a black silk handkerchief which
had two white stripes around the border from his pocket. With this he
wiped his eyes. “I raised you for just this purpose,” he said. The Sun
started to walk toward the horses. Their fly had told them not to touch
the saddles, that the Sun himself would fix them. “They belong to you,”
the fly said. “Everything is alive; the rope on the horse moves about of
itself. The saddle will jump on of itself.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> The fly told them this. The
halter was gone, the bridle and saddle blanket which had been lying on
the saddle were gone. The halter, bridle, and saddle blanket that had been
with the blue saddle were also gone. The Sun called them to come where he
was standing. They both went out again and the doors of the saddle room
and of the stable were shut.</p>

<p class='c000'>They went to the Sun, who was standing between the two horses so that
their heads projected as he held the bridles. They started away, the boys
walking in front of the Sun as he directed them to do. They passed through
the four doors to a post standing in front of the Sun's house. He led the
horses to the post where they stood without being tied.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a> There were four
chairs standing inside the Sun's house; and one by itself for the woman.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
His children sat on the chairs and his wife sat on the one which was hers.
The Sun addressed them as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“My boys, I will instruct you about the dangerous places you will
come to. The horses know the dangerous places on the way back. My wife
is pleased with you and treats you well. That is why you are to have these
horses, one of which is hers. The other is mine and so is the saddle, bridle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>halter, and saddle blanket. They are all mine. You will go back to your
kindred. When you are near, hurry. I will give you something.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sun got up and reached inside to a shelf from which he took up an
iron knife like a sword. Turning around he took up a bow and arrows
having iron heads. There were two of the arrows. “I give these to you,”
he said. “You are giving us these! Our mother did not know about them.
Why does she not give us something?” the boys said. The Sun's wife said
she would speak a few words to them. “You shall be my nephews. Your
mother shall be my sister. She shall be like me. Because of this I have
treated you well. She shall be the same as I. I become an old woman and
at other times I am as if I were two years old. She shall be the same way.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a>
You shall tell her this before the Sun travels far. I am the one telling you;
he did not tell you. I will name my sister. Your father will give you names.”
The Sun picked something up and was still holding it. “Wait, I will tell
you something and after that he will give you a name. I name her Nigostsanbikayo.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
Every one will call her that. She will come to me. You,
too, will come to me. I give a name to your mother. She will be called
Ests'unnadlehi and she will help you. I make a name for her, Ests'unnadlehi,
and with that she will help you. When she has children again they
will be two girls. These girls will belong to the people for there will be
people.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a> She will help them. I, too, will help them when they come to me.
He, too, will help his children. That is why I am telling you and you must
remember it well. I have finished. Your father will tell you about the
objects he is about to give you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sun gave the elder boy a weapon saying, “This will be called a
'blue sword.' You will use it against the monsters on the earth. Because
of that I gave you the name, Naiyenezgani.” He gave the weapon to him
saying, “That is all for you.” Addressing the younger, he said, “Now I
give this to you, Tobatc'istcini. You will use this which I give you against
those who prey upon people. You are to help each other. I shall be near
you watching you. Whatever you do will be known to me. It will be well
if you kill these evil ones. The people will live everywhere.” He gave
him the bow with the injunction that he should draw the bow three times
without releasing the arrow and then he should shoot the dangerous beings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>and they would fly apart. Having said this, he proposed they should eat
something. The Sun's wife was still sitting in her accustomed seat. The
men went to the table, well loaded with food prepared by some unknown
agency, and began to eat. The Sun's wife gave the elder one a spotted belt
with a yellow fringe hanging from its border.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they had finished the meal, the Sun said he did not know how
the visitors were to return. They went where the horses stood and the
Sun said, “Children, this stallion will go well in the lead. Now mount the
horses.” He held the stirrup and saddle horn and told the boys to get on.
They did so and rode away from the Sun's house where towards the east a
post stands up with white hair<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a> which reaches to the ground and turns up
again. The rain falls on it. They rode their horses around this post four
times and came back where they were standing before, as the Sun directed
them to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they had finished, the Sun's wife came up to them and told her
husband to count for his sons the two saddle blankets, two halters, two
bridles, two ropes, and two saddles. The Sun told them to start home;
that he was well acquainted with them. He charged them to take good
care of the saddle blankets and directed that the gray horse should go in
the lead because he knew the trail to the place midway between the earth
and the sky. From that point the sorrel horse was to lead because that
one knew the way from there on. When they returned where their mother
lived he told them to stake the horses out for four nights. The sorrel was
to be staked toward the east and the gray to the west. Having ridden the
horses among the people they were to unsaddle them in some good place.
A white saddle blanket was to be placed toward the east, a black one to the
south, a yellow one to the west, and a blue one to the north.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a> The bridles,
halters, ropes, and saddles were to be brought to the camp. He charged
them to keep in mind what he was telling, for he was telling them this that
they might be good men. He divided his property between his boys. He
told them after the horses had been running loose four days to go to them
early in the morning. This might be in any good place where canyons
meet, making a flat. When they came to them they were to hold out their
hands, palms upward, towards the horses. They were to catch the horses
while they were licking their hands. They were to consider what he told
them and when they should go for the horses after four days, the four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>canyons coming together would be full of horses. When their horses had
been caught by holding out their hands, the saddle blankets, one on the
other, were to be put on them and the horses were to be saddled. They
were to ride the horses all day until sunset when they were to be turned out
again. Having turned them out, they were told they might go the next
day to see what was happening. Having finished his speech he dismissed
the boys.</p>

<p class='c000'>They went with the Sun until they came to the top of the ridge, where
they stopped. The Sun felt the horses all over. He felt of their legs, their
feet, their faces, their ears, their manes, their backs, petting them. “Goodbye,
my horses,” he said, “travel well for my boys down to the earth. There
is food for you on the earth the same as here.” He addressed the gray
horse, telling him to be the leader on the way toward the earth since he
knew the way. He told the boys not to look at the horses' feet nor to
look behind them, but to keep their eyes fixed on the tips of their ears.</p>

<p class='c000'>They started; before they knew it the horses had changed places, and
the sorrel was leading. They thought the earth was far off but they soon
found the horses were trotting along on the earth. Now the horses were
running with them toward their camp. They rode up slowly where the people
were walking about. They rode to the camp side by side, and the people
all ran out to look at them. Their mother was standing outside watching
them and they rode up one on each side of her. “Mother, Ests'unnadlehi,
unsaddle our horses,” they said to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>The people all came up to them. The woman, laughing, ran her hand
over the horses saying, “Your father gave you large horses.” When the
people had all come there, the boys told them to call their mother Ests'unnadlehi.
They all called her by that name. The older boy said they were
to call him Naiyenezgani. The younger one said they were to call him
Tobatc'istcini.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a> They addressed them saying, “When we were here before
you used to laugh at us because we were poor. We used to walk because
we were poor. We have visited our father where he lives. The Sun's wife
named our mother. Call me Naiyenezgani. That one was given the name,
Tobatc'istcini. These will be our names and be careful to call them correctly.
Do not come near these horses. We will stake one out here and
the other one there. They will remain tied out four days. You may go.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Before sundown on the fourth day the horses whinnied. They went to
their horses and saddled them. They rode around among the camps until
sundown and then rode them to a flat where four canyons came together.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>They hung a white saddle blanket toward the east, a black one to the south,
a yellow one to the west, and a blue one to the north. Their fly told them
to hang the blankets in four places, making an enclosure of them. After
four days they were to come and would find conditions different. He
charged the boys not to miss doing just as their father had told them.
They went back to the camp carrying the saddles, bridles, halters, and ropes.
After two days had passed their fly flew away. He returned, reporting
that there were many horses filling the place where the four canyons came
together. The next day he reported that the horses were so thick one could
walk on their backs. The next day (the fourth), about sunrise, the two
boys went there with their ropes in their hands. When they came to the
eastern canyon it was full of white horses, the southern one was full of black
horses, the western was full of yellow horses, and the northern canyon with
blue (gray) horses.</p>

<p class='c000'>They took down all the saddle blankets and piled them together. With
valleys in four directions full of horses they did not know their former
horses from the others. They considered how they might distinguish them.
The horses were milling around near where a blanket hung. They were all
mingled together with the colors mixed. The men approached the horses
but they stopped before they got to them. They extended their hands
with pollen on the palms and the horses whinneyed. Then two horses
trotted up to them and licked the pollen from the hands of their owners
who caught them while they did it.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a> They led these horses back to the
camp where the saddles, etc., were lying.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they led these two horses all the others followed. Their fly told
them all about the two horses, what they had done, and that they had made
many horses for them. Four days from now it would come about that the
broad earth would be covered with horses. Their fly flew to the Sun's
camp and the Sun instructed him. “Drive the horses over this way and
put a halter on top of that mountain; put a rope on the top of this mountain
to the south; put a halter on the top of the mountain to the west;
and put a rope on the mountain to the north. Your father says this,”
the fly told them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The older of the brothers told the people that they should ride the
horses and not think they were wild. “Catch any of them and saddle
them. When you have ridden your horses, then do not go near them for
four days. Keep away from the horses which are inside where the halters
and ropes are lying. Turn the horses loose in the space enclosed by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>ropes and the halter. If they see you they may stampede. These horses
will be of great value to you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The brothers rode the two horses and the others all followed. When
the two horses whinneyed, the others all answered. They took off the
ropes and went back to camp. They asked their mother to put up two
posts and to put a smooth pole across their tops. She was asked to put
the saddles on this pole with their horns toward the east.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a> The bridles
were to be hung on the saddle horns and the saddle blankets spread over
the saddles. They asked her to think about the saddles where they were
lying during the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>She kept her mind on the saddles during the night and in the early
morning she went out to them. There were four saddles on the pole where
there had been only two. She still kept her mind on the saddles and the
next morning there were six lying there. “My child,” she said, “you
spoke the truth. I kept my mind on the saddles and six are now lying
there.” Tobatc'istcini said, “Very well, keep thinking about them all
night and go to them early in the morning.” When she went out, there
were eight saddles on the pole.</p>

<p class='c000'>Naiyenezgani said he was going yonder and would be back by sunset.
He went to the mountain top where the halter lay. The Sun was standing
there. “It must be my father,” he said. “I did not know you. I am
glad you came down to me.” “Well, my son,” the Sun replied, “let us go
around the horses.” “What time will it be when we get around them?”
the son asked. Leaving the place where the halters were lying they went
where the ropes were. The space was level full of horses. “Fine, my
son,” the Sun said to Naiyenezgani, “with ropes and halters you made a
fence so the horses cannot get out. You have this broad world for a corral.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They went on and came where the halters were piled up. “These
halters will round up the wild horses for you and you will put them on their
heads.” They went on and came where the rope hung. “These ropes
will drive the horses together for you. They will drive the wild horses
close to camp for you.” They started back and came where Naiyenezgani
had met the Sun. “I have done everything for you,” the Sun said. “Now
I am going back and leave you. You too will go home. Tomorrow it will
be finished. You will give your people two horses apiece. Give each of
them one stallion and one mare. Distribute them from noon until sunset.
These horses are mares and stallions in equal numbers. Tonight two
saddles are to be placed on the pole you put up. You shall keep three
saddles and give away seven. When you give away the horses give away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>seven saddles. Now my son, we separate. Shake hands. Others will do
as we do.” They said <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">njo</span></i> to each other and separated. It was not long
before he was back and stood there as the sun set. He was happy and
laughing. “Where have you been, my son?” his mother asked. “You
must have been in a good place or you would not be laughing.” “What
did you say, mother?” he replied. “I am happy; when I came over there
where the halter lay I met my father. I walked with him all day. As
we walked around the horses he told me about everything. I am happy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He said that none of them should go out tomorrow, but that he himself
would go out early. When he went out there in front of the yellow saddle
lay a white saddle. Behind that was a blue one. Between them was a
yellow saddle. The pole was full. There were ten saddles in a row. “I
told you to put up a long pole, and you put up a short one,” he said to his
mother. “You said dig one hole here and another there, my son,” she
replied. “Just these may well be our saddles,” he said. He called Tobatc'istcini,
saying they would go to catch the horses. “You go to the rope
over there. I, too, will go to the other rope. Hurry, we will catch the
horses,” he said to him. He ran where one rope was, and the other one
went where the other rope was. When they came to the two ropes, they
circled around, driving the horses all towards each other. They could not
find their own horses, the Sun's horses. They went into the enclosure and
walked around. Even when they went around that way they could not
find the horses. They looked for them again, going around among the
other horses, but they could not find them. The horses touched each
other, they were so thick.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Tobatc'istcini said, “Naiyenezgani, why do you act so? Is
your mind gone? You say you met your father yesterday and that you
spent the day going around the horses. He took them out of the herd,
and away from you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Naiyenezgani caught a black stallion and the other brother a sorrel
gelding. When they led them to the camp their mother asked Tobatc'istcini
why he had caught a sorrel and told him to turn him loose and catch a
white gelding. She said the gray and sorrel horses were made for them
and that they were well trained the day before. She told them to hurry
and drive the horses in. Tobatc'istcini rode the sorrel horse back and
unsaddled it. He then caught a white horse and drove the gray horses
back to the camp.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us go,” he said to his brother. They mounted the horses and rode
along. Their mother spoke to them, “My boys, take off that yellow saddle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>and put on a white one.” When they came riding back where their mother
was, a horse whinneyed. It sounded like the voice of the gray stallion that
used to be his horse. Another horse whinneyed in this direction and the
voice was like that of the sorrel mare. They knew their horses when they
whinneyed and one said to the other, “Brother, those are our horses whinneying
but we cannot do anything about it.”<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a> “Let us hurry,” the other
said. They rode toward the herd of horses but the horses started to run
and the herd broke up. While they were looking they ran where their
horses whinneyed. Their fly told them that the horses had already run
into the enclosure and that the four doors were shut. They heard them
whinneying far away. Their fly said the horses were already in their
stable, but they still whinneyed. They drove the other horses near the
camp. The older brother told the people to form in a line around the
horses. He said they were going to stake out horses for them. The people
replied that they had no ropes, that only the two brothers had them. They
asked the brothers to make ropes for them. They were told to wait while
they returned where the horses used to be. They told them that they
would have ropes the next day. The brothers went in different directions,
calling to each other. They met and sent their fly to the Sun because the
people were without ropes. He told his brother to go back where he had
been staying. He directed him also to take the bridle off and to leave the
rope as it was, tied to the saddle. “When the Sun is in the middle of the
sky we will drive the horses back. Although it is late the Sun will be in
the same place.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a> He (the Sun) may give us something,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fly returned and reported: “Your horse was standing behind him.
He sat watching where the stallions were fighting each other. He kept
looking at them and then he went a little way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sun's disk was yellow as at sunset. He looked down four times.
The yellow beams struck under his raised knees. From the other side
they also streamed toward him. Nothing happened, and he got up and
went to his horse. When he put his foot in the stirrup and mounted, ropes
were tied in four places to the saddle strings where there had been no ropes
before. Both saddles were that way. They both mounted together and
their horses pawed the ground and snorted. He rode back to the camp,
loping, and the other horses strung out behind him. The other brother
was running his horse on the other side. They stopped near the camp.
The horses were all lined up facing him. He called to the one on horseback,
“Come here.” He rode up to him and he asked how many ropes there were.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>The other replied he did not know for he had not counted them, and inquired
of the other how many ropes he had. The first speaker replied that he did
not know. Then the younger brother said the other should catch the
horses for them and lead them out while he remained on his horse where
he was. The other brother then rode among the horses and caught a mare.
He led the horse out and gave the rope to one of the men. He rode back
among the horses and caught a stallion. When he had caught six horses,
the ropes were all gone. He beckoned with his hand and his brother rode
up to him. “Had you only six ropes?” he asked. “Yes, I only had six
and I have caught six horses. Now, take your turn and I will remain here
on horseback.” The second brother caught the horses and reported that
he had chosen the better horses. The horses were all good but some of them
looked to be small.</p>

<p class='c000'>They told the people there were only seven saddles and that so many of
the men might have saddles, but that the others must ride around bareback
for the present. He told them that some time they might have saddles
because the Sun knew of their need and he himself knew it. He instructed
them to tie out their horses close by. He said if they heard the horses
nickering they would know that the stallions were covering the mares.
They would also know the colts when they were foaled. If they turned
their horses loose they might not know them. The ropes he said would
guard their horses for them. They would now drive back the other horses
while those who had received horses staked theirs out.</p>

<p class='c000'>He drove the horses away and hung his bridle up. The other one he
laid in another direction. He took the saddle and everything else back to
the camp. They came back to the camp in the middle of the night but
they did not know it was night because the Sun had not moved.</p>

<p class='c000'>When two days had passed two men came. There were many horses
where they had passed. They reported that something was running around
the other side of this large mountain. They did not know what it was, nor
to whom it belonged. They wondered what was meant and sent their
fly to find out. He flew away and came back almost immediately. He said
it was true. On the ridge beyond the mountain he saw horse tracks and a
trail with dust as fine as flour.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the brothers asked his mother to cook for the men quickly. It
was while they were eating that the fly reported. “Fly back there,” he
directed him. He told the visitors to remain, for they were no doubt tired.
They went back where the bridle was lying. They took off the rope and
hung it toward the east. They spoke to the bridle asking that the horses,
wherever they went, should come back together during the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>The visitors were as the two brothers had been. They had no eyelashes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>or eyebrows. Their ears were round and their heads were smooth.
There were webs between their fingers and toes. When they were asked
whence they came they replied that they had assumed there were people
living somewhere. Their own people had been killed off by something until
only the two were left. They saved themselves at night by digging a
trench and covering it with a large rock. When they started away, one
of the brothers asked where they were going. They replied that they did
not know where they were going but preferred not to stay where they were.
They said they did not like to be with many peoples. They preferred staying
there with their present hosts. Naiyenezgani asked them to tell their
story during the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>When night came, he called four men to come and listen to what the
visitors were about to tell. He asked each of the four men to question the
guests. “What is the country called where you live and what kind of thing
is killing your people?” he asked. “Tell us about it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The place where we live is called <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">danagogai</span></i>, plain. Something has
been killing our kinsfolk. It has been killing people everywhere on the
earth. We do not know what to do,” one of them replied. Naiyenezgani
told another of the men to question them. He asked if it were really true
that they had been living in that place, saying he did not believe what the
other had said. One of the guests replied that it was true. He said they
did not know how to tell untruths and that it was not right to do so. “While
we are here in camp it will kill someone.” He added, “I have finished.”
The second questioner said, “Why did you tell us this? We are uneasy
about it.” They replied that they were afraid of it and therefore came there
where they intended to live with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Naiyenezgani called upon a third man to question them. “Why did
you leave a trail for them?” he inquired. “When your kinsfolk were all
killed, why did you come to us leaving a trail?” The same man spoke
again. He directed that the next day a sweatbath should be prepared
that they should take a bath with the two visitors.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You said the horses had gone far away. I presume they have already
come together again,” he said. “These some-kind-of-things you said were
going away we call horses. That is all I have to say.” “These two will
speak to you,” one of the company said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot promise that I will kill that thing which has been killing your
people. Hurry to build the sweatlodge he mentioned,” Tobatc'istcini said.
“Make the sweatbath: we are going for the horses,” he added.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the night the horses had come together. One bridle was lying
at the east and the other at the west. They told the horses they must all
stay there together. When the brothers returned the sweatlodge was built
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>and the stones were on the fire. Tobatc'istcini directed that the men should
stand in line while four of them should go into the bath four times. He said
that when they had come out the fourth time the visitors would be like
themselves. “You built this sweatbath, but it belongs to the Sun,” he
told them. When he (Naiyenezgani) went in with them the fourth time he
asked them where the thing was living which was killing them. The visitors
replied that he lived down this way, pointing toward the west. “The
one that has killed all of our people has something long for a weapon,” he
added. Naiyenezgani said, “Well, he has been killing you.” When they
came out the fourth time they all looked alike. They ate and after the meal
the brothers told them all to remain there while they went to yonder white
mountain ridge to look beyond. He looked at the Sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>They landed far away on the mountain ridge.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a> Beyond that mountain
they went to another. There was a plain on which a mountain was standing.
They landed next on that mountain. Tobatc'istcini said, “Brother,
is the dangerous thing feared by you? If you are afraid, I am afraid. If
you are not afraid neither am I afraid. You are the elder, I am the
younger.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A man was walking in a valley without brush. He was the one who
kills people. They sent their fly to look over the body of their enemy, to
examine his ears, his eyes, and his mouth. The fly flew to the man and
alighted on his ear. When he alighted on his nose the man said, “It is not
just you. You smell like a man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The fly reported that they could not come up to the man, for while he
walked in one direction he could see behind because he had eyes in the
back of his head. He had no eyes in front. “He has something long in his
hand with which he kills people. When I sat on his nose he told me I
smelled like people,” the fly reported. “He is the same sort of a person
that you are.” The fly told them to go around to a certain gap in the ridge,
where the monster was accustomed to pass, and stand side by side. He
promised to let them know when the enemy approached. When the
monster walked along, the fly came back where the brothers were standing
side by side and said, “He is coming up here very close. If he stops here
you must cut his head off. Now, you shoot him,” he said. “If he sees
anyone he makes a sweep with his long weapon and kills the person even
a long way off.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The man came close to them and stopped. One of them shot him and
the other cut his head off. He stood just as he was before. They shot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>again and cut his head off again. The head fell but came back on again.
One of them shot at him the third time and the other cut his neck off again.
Then one of them ran around in front of him and shot him in the heart.
This time his flesh flew apart and was scattered over considerable space.
The flesh was quivering. That which they killed was called Naiye'. “That
is why he named you Naiyenezgani,”<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a> their fly said. “Because you and
Tobatc'istcini both will kill dangerous beings your father named you that.”
“You did this in his presence. He was looking at you and prevented
the monster's making any move against you. He gave you the weapons
with which you killed him. He did it for the good of mankind. Turn the
head over and look at its face,” their fly told them. They turned him over
and looked at his face. His face was like anyone's but he also had eyes
in the back of his head.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c010'><sup>[28]</sup></a> No one could attack him from in front, and he had
eyes to see behind himself also. His knife was sharp and the handle was
good. “Let us take the knife to convince the people. If we do not have
the knife, they will not believe us if we claim we have killed the Naiye'
which used to kill people,” one of them said.</p>

<p class='c000'>On their return they landed on the white mountain ridge and returned to
the camp. When they had returned, Naiyenezgani directed that all the
people, including the children, should come together. He asked his mother,
because the people were assembling, to spread down a buckskin and to
place on it the arrows, his own weapon, and that of the slain Naiye'. He
asked the people to gather around it. He called the two visitors, asking
them to come to a designated spot. He told his brother to stand in a
certain position and said that he himself would stand in another place. He
said that he would address the people and told his brother to do the same.
“I am telling you this because you are seeing what you have not seen
before. You see today what our father gave us. Now you speak to them,”
he said to his brother.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tobatc'istcini spoke as follows, “My name is Tobatc'istcini. Our father
gave us these things lying here. A being called Naiye' was using that
weapon over there to kill people. He had killed all the people except the
two who are sitting over there. We killed him.” “You, Naiyenezgani,
speak to them again,” he said to his brother.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We started from here and we went up to the top of yonder mountain.
We went on to the top of a mountain standing beyond that. A small mountain<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
stands beyond that and we went up to its top. There we saw a man
walking in a valley. He<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a> went to him for us and returned. 'When he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>walks he is blind, but he has eyes in the back of his head,' he reported to us.
'He kills the people who are slipping up behind him.' Now he will not kill
anyone. We shall live safely.” He took up what used to be his knife and
carried it around for the people to see. The man's blood was on it, and it
was fearful to look at. “There is no place to take hold of it. I will take
hold of it here,” he said. “Do not look at this which used to belong to
Naiye'. It is dangerous. Have a meal and then go home. Look after
our horses well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Their mother asked why the two who had come to them should not
accompany them where the horses were. They went with them where the
horses were. “Catch the sorrel gelding when you want to. You can tell
it by the white spot on its shoulder,” he told one of them. To the other
he said, “You may catch this black one with a white spot on its forehead.
If we are away anywhere saddle them and ride them around among the
horses and through the camp. The horses look as if they were mean, as
if they had never had a rope on them, but they will not misbehave, they are
not mean and will not shy.” They started back and when they came to the
camp again they ate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two days after they had killed the Naiye' they said they were going
in a certain direction and that it might be late when they returned. They
went up to the top of a small sharp-topped mountain. They looked at the
Sun and, when it came up, yellow beams streamed out from the Sun's
disk. His breath took the shape of a rainbow. The sunbeams fell to the
ground over them. “It must be there,” he said. They started and landed
on a mountain top. From there they went to another and from that one
to a projecting ridge. Beyond that was a plain on which stood a blue mountain.
They landed on that. It seems that those who were killing the
people lived at a distance from each other and the people were living in the
center of the world. The killers of the people were working towards each
other.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two brothers stood on the mountain side by side. They were made
like their father. You could hardly see their bodies. They were killing
out the Naiye'. “Fly over the country and hunt him up. He is living
somewhere,” one of them said to the fly. It flew off and went around them
in a circle. The next time it went around in a smaller circle. He (the
monster) was coming behind them. He had eyes looking both ways, four
eyes. He held something crooked. He stopped and looked carefully
behind himself. He did not look in front. He could look straight up and
could see people down below. The fly looked him all over, at his eyes, his
ears, his nose, and his face. “You are a burr,” he said to the fly. The fly
thought he said he was going to catch him. He flew between the man's
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>legs and returned where the brothers were sitting. “Did you say Naiye'?
You have come to a dangerous place,” the fly said to them. “As he walks
along he looks carefully behind himself. When he stops he looks up and
he can see the people who are below.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c010'><sup>[31]</sup></a> He carries a long, crooked object
with which he makes a sweep at people he sees in the distance and catches
them with his hook.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The fly was sent again to find out from which point the monster could
be attacked with the best chances for success. They saw him walking
in the distance and then they saw him standing where he was accustomed
to come up the ridge. The fly reported that was a good place for the attack.
The brothers addressed each other. “What is the matter with you, Tobatc'istcini?”
Naiyenezgani asked. “You are the leader and should speak
first,” Tobatc'istcini replied. “Very well, you did not answer me. We
will attack him. I will cause large hail with thirty-two points to fall on
him. What are you going to do?” Naiyenezgani asked. “I will cause hot
rain to fall on him,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>They went to him where he was walking. The sky made a noise and it
began to rain. The two brothers came toward him behind this rain. He
put his hand to the top of his head. It was hot rain which was falling.
They could see him, but he could not see them. “Let him walk between
you,” the fly directed. He was already exhausted with the hot rain and
the hail. Naiyenezgani stood here and Tobatc'istcini there. The monster
walked here saying, “It is a bad time. I, too, where I am, it is a bad place.”
As he walked one of the brothers raised his bow and brought it down again,
shooting. His companion cut off the monster's head. It came back
immediately as it was before. They shot and cut his head off again. He
fell three ways. They did the same thing to him the fourth time and he
spread out like water. “There shall not be those who kill,” Naiyenezgani
said. “This is the way I do to Naiye'. Just let him float here in his blood.
The people will live happily on the earth. I have done well by them. Get
ready, brother, we will go back. We will take the weapon with which he
has been killing people.” He rolled this weapon up into a coil and put it
in his blanket. “Come, we will go back,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>They came back in the manner they went, landing on the successive
mountains until they reached the camp. They danced a war dance near
the camp. They danced, holding up the weapon they had taken.
“Mother, we are hungry, hurry and cook for us,” they said to her. When
they had eaten they asked their mother to assemble the people and to ask
the visitors also to come. She told the people to assemble, saying that her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>sons must have seen something during the day they had been away which
they would tell them about. When the people had come together the
weapon they had brought back was lying there, not as yet untangled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We killed one like the other one. We both did it, but I could have
done it by myself, if I had been alone. If he had been alone he too could
have done it by himself,” Naiyenezgani said. “We both attacked him
because we could do it quickly. We killed him quickly because our father
helped us. If it had been one of you, you could have done nothing with
this one that we call Naiye'. He would have killed you right away and
eaten you up. He had killed all the people who lived with these two men,
and just now he was coming for you. Before we had known it, he would
have killed us all. There are no people living on the edges of the earth.
We are all that are left. He killed people this way. Suppose that person
should come on you, he would kill you this way.” He threw the weapon
to a distant bush. It went around the tree and it was as if it had been cut
off. “He was killing people thus. Now we will live well and no one will
bother us. A man is going around the earth in one day and he will tell
us about it.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Tobatc'istcini started away and his mother spoke to him.
“My son, put on this belt,” she said, offering him the one the Sun's wife
had given her. “I am going around from here but today it is late, I will
go tomorrow,” he said. They went to bed. “Take good care of things
and do not be afraid of anything,” Tobatc'istcini said.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it was daylight their mother prepared a meal for them and they
ate. “Come back safely, my son, as the people said to you,” the mother
said. “I am going, but I do not know when I shall come back,” Tobatc'istcini
replied. He started, telling them to watch for him on a certain mountain
point. “I will be back about noon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He started away, traveling with a blue flute which had wings.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c010'><sup>[33]</sup></a> He went
with this from place to place and was back home before long. He went
entirely around the border of the world on which people were living. The
belt was a blue flute. He thought with it four ways and looked into it
four ways. Before noon a light rain fell on the projecting mountain.
That cleared off and then he came laughing. “It was not far, only so large,”
he said, joining the tips of his forefinger and his thumb. “Have you your
property ready?” he asked. “Have you collected everything that is ours?
Tomorrow we will give out the horses, one apiece to each of you. We shall
not give out horses again. Bring the horses near to the camp.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They brought the saddles, the bridles, the halters, the ropes, and the
blankets. They two went where the horses were. They caught some of
the horses and saddled them, and drove the other horses near the camp
where they herded them. They called the people to assemble and when
they came caught horses for them. He gave away ten horses in all. “I
will give you no more horses,” he said. “Tomorrow we will go different
ways.”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c010'><sup>[34]</sup></a> He drove the horses back where they stayed. “Stake out our
horses nearby and leave the saddles on them all night,” he said. “This is
all. You may go in any direction you like.” “This way,” pointing to the
east; “this way,” south; “this way,” west; or “this way,” north. “We
are going over here where the end of the world is,” some of them said.
Others said they were going to the end of the world in this direction. In
this manner, each party chose a location.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they had finished, they asked the brothers which way they were
going. They replied that they were going to drive their horses to the top
of yonder mountain (<i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">bitsanldai</span></i>). “Take good care of your horses. Look
after them for twelve days and then they will be accustomed to you. Now
you may go. We are going also.” He drove his horses away saying,
“None of you are going with us. I thought some of you would go with us.
You are only giving us back our mother. Go on, mother, let your horse
lead.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His mother inquired which way she should lead them. “Go on, go on,
I tell you,” he replied. She rode towards the east. Soon a little light was
to be seen under the horse. They went higher and higher until they came
to the mountain he spoke of. They rode their horses beside hers. “Wait,
mother,” he said and rode back. “Keep on down this mountain. It
is good country in this basin. We will live here,” he said. They talked
together. “You unsaddle over there, you over there, and you over there.
We will watch the horses.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Long ago the Sun set and, there in the west, he became the son-in-law
of Toxastinhn (Water-old-man) whose daughter he married. She, who was
to become the wife of the Sun, built a house with its door facing the sunrise.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>She sat in the doorway facing the rising sun from which the red rays
streamed toward her. These rays entered her and since her period was
about to occur she became pregnant as a result.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the child was born, its hands and feet were webbed. There was
no hair on its head and it had no nose. When the boy was grown up he
asked where his father lived. His mother replied that his father lived
where one could not go, for the Sun was his father. The boy asked again
where he lived. His mother said he lived at the sunrise, but that one could
not go there. The boy then said that he would go there and set out on the
journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>He came where the cliffs come down of themselves. They moved in
front of him. The lightning shot across with him. Beyond that place he
came to the mountain of cactus which formed a dark barrier in front of him.
There a black whirlwind twisted through for him so that he passed by.
From there he went on where the mountain of mosquitoes stood like a black
ridge in front of him. A female rain fell for him and the wings of the mosquitoes
became damp; then he passed over. From there he went on where
the mountains moved up and down toward each other. He jumped away
from them and then toward them, but in no way could he get through.
Black-measuring-worm, whose back is striped with lightning, bent over it
with him.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c010'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>He walked on toward the house of the Sun. As he was going along, near
sundown, a spider drew its thread across below the boy's knee and tripped
him. He got up and went back, but fell again at the same place. Wondering
why he had fallen, he started on again, when he saw the head of Spider-old-woman
projecting from her hole so far (three inches) away. “Grandchild,
where are you going?” she asked. He replied that he was going to
the house of his father, the Sun. She told him to come into her house
instead. He replied that the opening was too small. When assured that
it was large enough, he went in. She told him one could not go to the Sun.
The spider girls were lying there without skirts or shirts. They lay with
the head of one toward the feet of the next. Spider-woman asked what was
the piece of cloth tied to his shirt. He gave it to her and she worked with
it all night; and the next morning each girl had a shirt and a skirt. She
made them from the young man's piece of cloth.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When the Sun rose, Spider-old-woman went out-of-doors. “It is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>yet time, my grandson,” she said. She held up five fingers horizontally
and said it would be time when the Sun shone over them.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a> When the time
came to go, they set out toward the house of the Sun. He came to the front
of the house where there were twelve doors and all of them were shut.
Without anyone opening a door for him, he came to Sun's wife. “What
sort of a person are you?” she asked. He replied he had come to see his
father. The woman warned him that no one was allowed around there.
She rolled him up in a blanket,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a> which she tied with lightning, and hid him
by the head of the bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the sun set, he heard the noise of the Sun's arrival. The Sun
came inside his house. “I do not see anyone,” he said, “but from the
mountain where I go down some man had gone along.” “You tell me you
do not have love affairs where you go around. This morning your son
came here.” She went to the head of the bed, undid the lightning with
which he was tied up and took the boy out. The Sun saw it was his boy.
There were twelve pipes in which tobacco was burned. The Sun fixed a
smoke for him in one of these. It was not the Sun's proper tobacco, but a
kind that killed whoever smoked it. The boy drew on the pipe just once
and the tobacco was burned out. The Sun prepared another pipeful, which
was gone when the boy had drawn on the pipe twice. He filled a third pipe;
this time the boy drew on it three times and the tobacco was consumed.
The last time the pipe was filled, the boy drew four times before the tobacco
was burned out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward the east, there was a blazing fire of black <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">yabeckon</span></i> into which
the Sun threw the boy. He turned into a downy feather and landed in
front of his father who expressed his surprise. There was a fire of blue
<i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">yabeckon</span></i> toward the south into which the boy was next thrown. He again
turned into a feather and landed in front of his father. The fire toward the
west was of yellow <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">yabeckon</span></i> from which the boy escaped in the same manner.
Finally, the boy was thrown into a white fire of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">yabeckon</span></i> which blazed up
in the north. He escaped in the same manner as before. Each time when
the boy was thrown in, the fire had been poked with lightning of the corresponding
color.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the boy had successfully withstood this last test, the Sun directed
his wife to prepare a sweatbath. She did this by spreading four blankets of
cloud: black, blue, yellow, and white. She put on the four blankets from
the four sides in proper rotation. The Sun went in with all his boys. While
they were in the bath, the skin between the boy's fingers and toes was pulled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>back and joints made in his fingers. He was also provided with hair, eyebrows,
eyelashes, nose, and ears. Hair was placed on his body and nails
supplied for his fingers and toes. Counting this boy, the Sun had twelve
sons with whom he formed a line. He then asked his wife to find him
in the line, but this she was unable to do because they all looked alike, she
said.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sun then placed a gun and a panther-skin quiver on a shelf and
asked his son to choose which he would have. After sighting the gun, he
concluded he did not like it. He put the quiver over his shoulder and took
out two arrows. When he tried these, he hit the target in the center. He
chose the panther-skin quiver saying he liked it.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c010'><sup>[41]</sup></a> All the other sons of the
Sun had guns. The Sun had them shoot at each other in fun. Those
who had guns beat the boy who had arrows and drove him off.</p>

<p class='c000'>On one side, horses were being made and on the other deer. The one
who was in charge of making these is named Iltca'nailt'ohn.</p>

<p class='c000'>They put, for him, a light brown mountain, inside of which, cattle, goats,
sheep, pigs, horses, mules, and donkeys were living. All these are the food
of white people. In this mountain also were guns, blankets, and all kinds
of metals.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other side he put, for him, a mountain on which century plants
were growing with their yellow flower stalks standing all around the edges.
On this mountain, too, were sunflowers, yellow with blossoms, cactus, yucca,
piñon, oaks, junipers, the fruit of all of which was perpetually ripe. All the
other wild vegetable foods of the Indians grew there also. The mountain
was always yellow with flowers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sun asked the boy which of these two mountains he would choose.
He decided to take the one which was yellow with flowers where fruit was
always ripe. He did not care for the light brown mountain which stood
toward the east. He announced that the yellow mountain would be his
and would belong in the future to the Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>They then opened a door in the side of the brown mountain and drove
out cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, horses, donkeys, and mules. These became
the property of your white people's nation. The Sun's son asked that some
horses be given him. The Sun reminded him he had asked for the other
mountain, and wanted to know why he had not then asked for horses.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the east, mirage people rounded up some horses for him. The red
dust of the round-up covered the ground. “There are no horses,” the Sun
said. The boy asked again for horses only to be told he should have asked
before when he chose between the two mountains. He asked, that notwithstanding,
he be given some horses. The Sun took up a rope and led
back a chestnut stallion from the east. He tied the horse which stood
pawing the ground and nickering. The boy rode back on it to the place
where I suppose Toxastin and his grandmother lived. He rode back in a
single day and tied his horse. The horse kept nickering and pawing the
earth all the time; he would not graze and the boy was not satisfied. He
rode back to the house of the Sun, took off the rope; and the horse ran off
toward the east kicking up his heels.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy told his father, the Sun, that the stallion he had given him was
not satisfactory, and that he had come to ask for a different horse. His
father went away and returned with two horses, a stallion and a mare.
“These are what you want, I suppose,” the Sun said, and gave the boy a
rope, a halter, a saddle blanket, and a saddle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy led the horse back to the place where Toxastin, his grandmother,
and his mother lived. He led the horses back to a place called Cottonwood-branches-hang-down.
To the south, blue cottonwood branches
hung down; to the west, yellow cottonwood branches hung down; to the
north, white cottonwood branches hung down. The place was named the
center of the earth. The saddle was placed at the east; the saddle blanket
at the south; the halter, at the west; and the rope, at the north.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the dry stream bed to the east, black burdocks grew; to the south,
blue burdocks grew; to the west, yellow burdocks; and to the north, white
burdocks. He turned out the two horses here to the east. Each time the
Sun's son came back there, he found the two horses playing. After four
days, he drove the horses up the valley a little way four times. When he
went the fourth day to see them he found the tracks of a colt.</p>

<p class='c000'>That cottonwood tree stood in the center. On the east side of it a
black stallion stood; on the south side, a blue stallion; on the west side, a
yellow stallion; on the north side, a white stallion. Horses were walking
around in the valleys to the east, south, west, and north. Thus there came
to be horses here on the earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>They did not put this large one (the earth) that lies here in place before
my eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind blew from four directions. When there was no way to make
the earth lie still, Gopher, who lives under the earth, put his black ropes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>under the earth. Here his black rope lies under it; here his blue rope; here
his yellow rope; and here his white rope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over here (east) they made a black whirlwind stand with black metal
inside of it. Here (south) a blue whirlwind and blue metal were placed;
here (west) a yellow whirlwind and yellow metal; and here (north) a white
whirlwind and white metal. With these standing on all sides, the earth
came to its proper place and was stable.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now that this is as it should be, what shall we do next?” said one of
them. “To what purpose have we had such a hard time making this earth
lie properly which otherwise would have been unstable?” Then he began
to pat it with his hand. “Let a black cloud move about sprinkling,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There will be life from this; the world will be alive from the dampness,”
he said. “They did well by us, what shall we do? Now thank you,”
they said.</p>

<p class='c000'>The people had nothing. The one who was in charge (the Sun); that
one only was walking around. “It will turn out well with him walking
about,” they said. They looked well at the one they meant. “That one
is the Sun,” they said. “We did it in the presence of that one walking
about.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Ests'unnadli said she would do something unseemly. Thinking
she would do it where the Sun first shone in the morning, she seated herself
there. She was doing this only that people might live. There were no
people and she thought there should be many and she did it for that reason.</p>

<p class='c000'>She became pregnant. She and the one walking around were the only
ones who understood about generation. She gave birth to a child there
where she sat. She went back to the child early each morning for four
mornings and on the fourth, the child walked back with her. He was
entirely dressed as he walked back with her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is not good that there should be only this one,” she said. “It will
be well for me to do an improper thing again.” She sat repeatedly where
the water was dripping and became pregnant again. She gave birth a
second time to a child. “I will do as I did before,” she said. She went to
her child early each morning for four mornings. The fourth morning after
he was born, the child returned with her. He was dressed in buckskin,
shoes and all.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had given birth to two children. The latter one she named Tobate'isteini
and the first one Bilnajnollije.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c010'><sup>[43]</sup></a> They were the children of this one
(the Sun).</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>A black water vessel by the door of the sun's house was flecked with
sunshine. He caused dark lightning to dart under it from four directions.
He caused it to thunder out of it in four directions. He caused it to thunder
in four directions. He caused male rain to fall in four directions. He
caused fruits to stand on the earth in lines pointing in four directions.
“Thanks,” they said, “he has treated us well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A yellow water vessel by Ests'unnadlehi's door was flecked with light.
She caused yellow lightning to pass under it from four directions. She
caused it to thunder from it toward four directions. She caused female
rain to fall four times in four directions. She caused fruits to stand in
lines converging from four directions. “Thanks, she has treated us well,”
they said. “Because of her, things are well with us.” “She caused the
wind to agitate the grass from four directions for us,” they said. “With
no trouble for us it comes to its place. The earth will remain well for us,”
they said. “It is still the same way for us that it was long ago. We are
thankful yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mother, where does our father live?” the boys asked. “Do not ask,
for he lives in a dangerous place,” Ests'unnadlehi replied. “Do not say
he lives in a dangerous place but show us where it is, for we are going there,”
they replied. “If you go you must travel only by night. During the day
one must sit still,” she told them. She said this, for she meant for them to
make the journey without being seen by the Sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>They wondered why she told them to go only at night and resolved to
travel by day. They came near where the ground was black with mosquitoes
that had teeth of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">becdiłxił</span></i>, and there was no way to pass through them.
They caused a rain, yellow with sunshine, to fall on them and wet their
wings so that they stuck to the trees. By this means, they passed beyond
them. “This is why she said it is dangerous,” they said to each other.
They came where the earth was crossed with a stripe of cactus which had
spines of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">becdiłxił</span></i>. A black whirlwind with a core of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">becdiłxił</span></i> passed,
twisting through the cactus; the boys got by it. “This was surely the
bad place of which our mother told us,” they said. As they were going
on toward their father's house, they came to sand which, if one stepped on
it, rolled back with him. There was no way to get through it. A big
black measuring worm having his back striped with a rainbow, bent himself
over the sand for them and they crossed over. They were now approaching
their destination when they found the house surrounded by thirty-two
lakes which could not be avoided.</p>

<p class='c000'>A turquoise bird sat in the ear of one of them and directed them on
their way. The Sun's wife saw the two men pass through, avoiding the four
bodies of water that surrounded the house. She concealed them under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the bed which stood in the house. When the Sun returned, he saw the
tracks of two men and asked where they had gone. The Sun's wife replied
that they were not there. “You are always saying you have made no
visits and yet your two sons come here,” she said. The Sun directed that
they should come to him. They sat facing him. He had tobacco hanging
in sacks in four places. It was black tobacco which grew on stalks of
<i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">becdiłxił</span></i>. He had a turquoise pipe with thirty-two<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c010'><sup>[44]</sup></a> holes for the tobacco
to burn in. With this tobacco, he killed those who were not really his
children. They heard him draw on the pipe once and then he tapped it
on something and the ashes rolled out. “Fix me a smoke, that is why
I came,” one of the boys said.</p>

<p class='c000'>They two went to the sack which was hanging on this side. It was filled
with large blue tobacco which grew on stalks of <em>becdoł'ije</em>. He filled a pipe
with thirty-two bowls and lighted it again. Having drawn on the pipe, he
passed it to them. He heard them draw on the pipe once and then the
ashes fell out.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Prepare a smoke for me, for I came for that purpose,” one of the boys
said again. When the other kinds, yellow, and white had been tried from
the remaining world-quarters, one of the boys produced some tobacco and a
pipe made of clay with a hole through it. “This is my pipe and my
tobacco,” the boy announced. “Why did you not tell me before that you
had tobacco?” the Sun said. He had chairs placed and took a seat between
the two boys. The three looked just alike. “Come, Djingona'ai,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c010'><sup>[45]</sup></a>
move yourself,” the Sun's wife said, so that she might distinguish him from
the others. “They are surely my children,” the Sun declared. “What
do you desire?” he asked them. The boys said they had come to hear
him ask that. The Sun urged them to ask for what they wished without
delay as he had many things.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sun had domesticated animals in four corrals on four sides of his
house. He had four kinds which were bad. They were bear, coyote, panther,
and wolf, of which one is afraid. He led a bear from the eastern corral,
remarking that this was probably the sort they meant, that it was his pet.
The boys refused it, saying they had come for his horse. In turn he led
animals from corrals at the south and west which were refused each time
on the advice of the monitor that sat in the ear of one of the boys. The
Sun pretended he had no other horse, that he was poor. The monitor
urged them to persist in their request, saying that the Sun could not refuse.
He finally led to them one of the horses which was walking around unconfined.
He was just skin and bones. The rope also was poor. “Did you
ask for this one?” the Sun said. “That is the one,” they replied. The
Sun told them the horse could not travel far, but the boys said that was the
animal they wanted.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave them the horse with the admonition that they must not let
Ests'unnadlehi see it or she would send them away with it, it looked so
bad. The boys assured him it would be all right. He replied that she
would be surprised at least. He requested them to tell Ests'unnadlehi
that he, the Sun, always told the truth. He charged the two boys that
they should not lie to each other. “This is a good day for you both,” he
told them. “Thank you, Ests'unnadlehi, my mother, thanks.” “Thank
you, Djingona'ai, my father. It is true that it is fortunate for us. It
was for that reason you raised us,” they said.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c010'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The Sun was the one who arranged the ceremony for unclean women.
She (Ests'unnadlehi) sat thus on her knees and the red light from the sun
shone into her. She was living alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she becomes a woman they straighten her. The people stand
in a line and sing while the drum is beaten. They dance four nights.
They paint her with white clay that she may live a long time, and that her
hair may get white on one side of her head. They put up a cane with a
curved top for her around which she is to run. At one side a basket stands
in which there is tobacco and on the other side a basket containing corn.</p>

<p class='c000'>When she has run around the cane in its first position, it is put up again
farther away, where she runs around it again and returns to the line of
singers. Again, the cane and basket of corn are moved out and the girl
runs around them. When she returns to the singers she dances, having a
downy feather tied at the crown of her head. The cane is put up again and
the basket of corn moved once more. The girl runs around them returning
to the singers. This cane is said to be the sun's cane and the chief's cane.</p>

<p class='c000'>The corn is poured from the basket over the crown of the girl's head.
The people all try to get a handful of the corn. After that, she throws
the blankets in every direction and the people pick them up, saying, “May
her blankets be many.” They plant the corn and all say they raise large
crops in consequence.</p>

<p class='c000'>They prepare Gans and dance four nights. They do not allow anyone
to sleep during the dancing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The girl, Ests'unnadlehi, has a skirt and a shirt of dressed skin. The
shirt is spoken of as fringed shirt and the skirt, a fringed skirt.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Gans dance, the girl dances behind them. She does not
sleep during the four nights.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the morning after the fourth night all the people gather around to
insure good luck in the future. The sun's songs, the chief's songs, are
sung and with them they dance. After the four nights they paint the
girl white with gypsum mixed with water which is in a shallow basket.
The girl stands here and a woman whose husband is rich in horses and
other property stirs the gypsum and water with a hairbrush. She applies
this white mixture to the girl's head, and brushes her downward until
she is whitened all over. The girl then sprinkles the men, women, and
children who stand around in a large circle. This is done that they may
be fortunate in the future. If some of the white mixture falls on the hair,
that person will have gray hair at that spot.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>They say they moved about from place to place under the cliffs. “We
will move to a place where we will not die,” they said. They went to a
place halfway between the earth and sky, and lighted on a mirage. They
were dying there too. They came back to this world. Wind and rain
ceased.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mocking bird said he wanted to be chief. Gopher said he wanted to be
chief. When someone remarked that the chief's eyes were small, Gopher
was angry and went under the ground, taking with him the wind and rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Humming bird started over the earth, hunting in vain for the wind and
rain. He came where Gopher had gone underground and went in there
and came where the Gans were living. They had much corn and ripe crops.
It rained there all the time. Humming bird came back and reported that
he had been where there were many ripe crops and where rain fell all the
time. He also said those who live there do not die. The Gans started
to move down there and on their way came to a place called “Two-mountains-go-around-each-other-in-opposite-directions.”
Rocks, white
and all colors, lie there, one above the other. The Indians went there
and came where the Gans were living.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>A small mountain stood at the east and on it Black Gan stood every
dawn and talked as a chief. When he had spoken as chief four mornings,
they asked why Black Gan was talking that way. All the Gans came together
and he talked to them. “May one of your children remain here?”
he asked. All the Gans said, “No. Our children are all going with us.”
Then Black Gan decided that one of his should stay. He left the youngest
little girl, putting a turquoise water jar by her pillow. He covered
this with earth. They started away where people do not die. His little
girl returned to the place where her water jar had been put. While she
was gone for it the others moved away and left her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some Indians found the baby, who was running about crying, and took
her to raise. When she was grown, she married, and gave birth to a boy.
Then Black Gan had a son-in-law and many people came to see him because
he was Black Gan's son-in-law. They crowded into the house and kept
saying, “Move over a little, Donaildihi.” He, Eats-a-long-time-without-being-satisfied,
moved over; and they kept coming in until the house was
stretched over to one side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Black Gan's son-in-law lay down with one leg over the other, and called
for the baby. When its grandmother brought it, he tossed it up and down
on his chest and sang to it. When he was done playing with it, he called
to them to take it again.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a time another boy was born. When they were both grown they
were hunting birds and came where the Gans were living. When they
returned, food was offered them in vain. They had eaten where the Gans
lived while away, and would not eat on their return.</p>

<p class='c000'>A man fell sick. His eyes and mouth were crooked, as were also his
arms and legs. The people were asking what they should do about it.
The man told the mother of the boys to prepare a deerskin which had no
holes in it with a piece of turquoise fastened at the forehead. To the
turquoise he asked that downy feathers be tied. She directed that <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">bacinϵ</span></i>
with downy feathers be tied between the eyes. In addition <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">tsϵltcϵϵ</span></i> and
<i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">yołgai</span></i> each with downy feathers were to be tied to the skin. She asked
that the skin prepared thus be placed on the top of the feet of the
children (Gan's grandchildren).</p>

<p class='c000'>When they put it on the foot of one of these boys, he kicked it to the other
boy, who kicked it back. When this had been done four times one of them
directed that wood be brought in, and they consented to give a dance for
the sick man. They directed that all the people should come together and
that the sick man should be brought to the dancing place. Preparations
were also made there for the fire. “All of you come here where we are
going to sing,” they announced.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they had come together they began to sing, the two grandsons of
Black Gan acting as leaders. When they started to dance one of them
stood up and made a speech. He told them they must not go away during
the dance or something bad would happen to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they had sung four songs, the sound of a bull roarer was heard
underground to the east, south, west, and north. The Gans ran there and
formed in line around him (the sick man). The Gans came to the dance
ground, and Black Gan shook himself by the side of the sick man. He took
the sick man up and threw him over there. Then Brown Gan shook
his body by the sick man and swayed from side to side. Then the
Gan who has one side of his face covered, shook himself by the sick man
and threw him over there. Next Red Gan swayed himself and took up
the sick man and threw him over there.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Black Gan then went to the sick man and made his eyes good
again. Brown Gan went to him and fixed his arms. The Gan whose
face is half covered fixed his back. On this side (north) Red Gan restored
his legs. The man was well again, and danced among the others. They
danced four nights and the morning after, the Gans and men stood with
their little fingers interlocked; first a man and then a Gan; a man and
then a Gan; a man and then a Gan. Thus they formed a circle, standing
in a line alternating, with their little fingers interlocked. They danced
until it grew light and then the dance began to move away toward the
sunrise. Old men and old women were lying down nearby. The dancing
people kept moving away toward the east. The old women and old men
ran after them. They were dancing on the ground and then began to move
up higher and higher in the air. The Indians ran after them but the Indians
who were dancing went up with the dance. They could hear the
sound of the dancing up there and the songs. They moved away to the
Sun. He sent them where they do not die. They are still living there,
I suppose. They are the people who do not die.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ganisk'ide<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c010'><sup>[50]</sup></a> was the only one who owned deer. He was the only one who
brought them home and who ate their flesh. He gave none of the meat to
the people who lived near him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ravens, who were then people, proposed that they make a puppy and
desert it. They did this; they moved away and left a puppy lying there.
When the children of Ganisk'ide went where the people had moved away,
they found the puppy. They took it up and carried it home.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ganisk'ide told the children to throw the puppy away, but when they
objected, he told them to try the dog's eyes by holding fire in front of them.
When they brought the fire near the dog's eyes it cried, “gai gai gai.” “It
is a real dog,” Ganisk'ide said. “You may take him behind the stone door
where the deer are enclosed and let him eat the entrails.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When the children had taken the dog behind this door he became a
man again. He moved the stone to one side and the deer that were inside
ran out. Ganisk'ide called to his wife from the doorway to touch the
nostrils of the deer with her odorous secretions. She touched each of the
deer on the nose as they ran by her and they received the sense of smell.
They ran away from her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You said it was a dog,” he said to his children with whom he was
angry, “but he turned them out for us.” The deer scattered all over the
earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>After he married, they went on a hunting trip. When they had established
camp where they were to get the deer meat, the man went out to
hunt, but the woman stayed at the camp. As the husband left, he said,
if anyone came from the north, that would be himself, but if someone came
from the east it would be someone else.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Ganłjine came there carrying a deer mask in his hand which he
put on the brush of which the camp was made, and sat down by the fire.
The deer mask was eating as if it were alive and it made a noise like a deer.
Ganłjine told the woman to put on the thing which was lying there. She
replied that a deer mask was something to be afraid of. “Put it on and
let me look at it,” he insisted. “Will it be all right?” she asked him. He
told her to put it on anyway, and stand at one side so he could look at it.
She put it on and stood at the place designated in the posture of a deer.</p>

<p class='c000'>He threw a turquoise ring on her, and she became like a deer as far as her
neck. Then he threw a ring of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">bacinϵ</span></i> on her and an additional portion of
her body changed to a deer. Next he threw a ring of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">tcϵłtcϵϵ</span></i>, and last, one
of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">yołgai</span></i>. She was then completely like a deer and walked away, wiggling
her tail.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward the east there are mountains called Iłijgo. There are four
mountains standing in a line, one back of the other. She who used to be a
woman and Ganłjine went there together. They were mating as they
went along, as could be told from the tracks. Deer tracks were in one
place and nearby, other deer tracks, but on one side a man's tracks. They
went toward the east.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the husband came back he saw by the tracks that a man had
visited the camp and had gone away with his wife. He went back to the
settlement and told them that the woman with whom he had gone to hunt
had gone off, leaving human tracks on one side and on the other side like a
deer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The people went in a company to the place where the man had camped
and commenced following the tracks that were human on one side and deer-like
on the other. While being trailed they ran from those who were following
them, who ran after them, chasing them around until the one who
had been a woman was worn out. They overtook her and threw on her a
ring of turquoise, followed by one of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">bacinϵ</span></i> and then one of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">tcϵłtcϵϵ</span></i>, and
finally one of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">yołgai</span></i>. As these rings fell on her she became progressively
human in shape. When she had become a human being again, they took
her back to the settlement. When it was time for deer to run again, she
became a deer once more, and then became a person again.</p>

<p class='c000'>When thunder was heard, they made a camp and went to hunt little
fawns which they were bringing into the camp. This woman who had
turned into a deer had little fawns which she had borne for a deer. She
went around among the houses where the fawns were being brought in and
found her own lying there dead. An Indian had killed them both and had
brought them in. When she learned a man had brought in pretty fawns,
with yellow around their eyes, she ran there and commenced to cry.</p>

<p class='c000'>She spoke, saying that the deer they should see along the trail where
she went with her children would be herself and that they should pray to
her.</p>

<p class='c006'>A boy started playing <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">najonc</span></i> and lost his arrows, his moccasins, his
breechcloth, his shirt, his headband, his hair, his eyebrows, and his eyelashes.
When he returned home so divested, his mother told him to go
away somewhere that she might not see him again.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>He started away, utterly naked as he was, and traveled until he came to
the edge of the ocean. He jumped into the water but was thrown back.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c010'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
He did this three times with the same result and then jumped in under the
water. When he looked back through the water it was white. He began
to eat all kinds of “worms” as he went along. He ate, also, some of the
green growth floating on the water. They came with him to the house
made of water. The fly that sat inside his ear gave him information
and advice. All the water people and the fog people went with him;
Water-old-man was among them and Water-youth with a downy feather
on the crown of his head. He was sent down that way with a message.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c010'><sup>[54]</sup></a>
They sent him where the black blanket of water is spread down.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Over there he is running along,” someone said. “Now to you they
are starting, Water-youths, to you they are starting. Yonder we are
coming, Water-youths are coming,” he said. “They are coming right
up the stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fog-youths are coming, right in front of the fog they are coming.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where the water stands straight up, next to him, the water people
are coming to us. With water-downy-feathers as their feathers they are
coming to us; holding the lightning in their hands they are coming to us.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where the fog stands straight up, standing next to me, they come to

the lightning in their hands they come to us.”<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c010'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The one who became water came by the house made of fog and water.
“Where is the place called 'House-of-water'?” he asked. “This place is
called 'House-of-water'” the water people replied. His monitor, fly,
told him they were not telling him the truth. He came to the house made
of water. “Where is the place called 'House-of-water'?” he asked. It
was Water Chief to whom he came. “It is called 'Water-house' right
here,” he replied. His fly told him that was correct; that 'Water-house'
was there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two vessels filled with water which was boiling, were by the fire.
“Drink all there is in one of the vessels,” he was told by Water Chief. He
drank the contents of one vessel and then vomited. He was saying, “wa,
wa,” as he vomited. He threw up all of the underwater “worms.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They bathed him with the contents of the other vessel. They commenced
to dance and danced for twelve nights without sleeping. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>they had danced twelve nights without his falling asleep they told him he
might go home.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Naiyenezgani danced there among them. His hat was white on
top. He held his hand outspread over him as he stood by him. Water-old-man,
too, danced among them. Water-house was on this side.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Water-youths all came here where they were dancing. With their
downy feathers of water they came there. They came to the dance ground
holding lightning in their hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“From 'House-made-of-fog,' Fog-girls came where they danced having
their downy feathers of fog. They held lightning in their hands.</p>

the dance being made of fog they started to dance with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They danced with the boy who became water.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Naiyenezgani danced among them. When they were looking somewhere
else Naiyenezgani became a baby again, and was tied in a basket
cradle. The attention of the people was attracted elsewhere and when
they saw Naiyenezgani again he was standing among the Water-maidens to
whom he did various things.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tobatc'istcini, too, was tied as a baby, then the two men did various
things to them. The twelve nights had passed without anyone sleeping.
He stood between the Water-maidens. The men from a distance made a

danced with him.</p>

water, stood here and there stood a Fog-maiden. When twelve nights had

was not speaking the truth. He reaffirmed his statement. He asked that
a sweathouse be built. When it was ready the boys went in and were
singing inside. The young man who had been turned into water started
to sing the water songs. Inside he wove lightning together again. There
had been no water songs and now they existed. Thus, there came to be
medicinemen for water.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>The Man who visited the Sky with the Eagles</span>.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c010'><sup>[59]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Long ago, there was a man who had a wife and two children, both boys.
He went with Coyote on a hunting trip and camped near where they expected
to secure game. He went out to hunt in the morning; and Coyote
also went by himself and, as he was walking along, he came where there
was an eagle's nest on a point of rock jutting out in the middle of a high
cliff. There were young eagles in the nest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coyote returned to the camp and reported to the hunter that he had
seen young eagles in a nest. Saying he wished some good feathers for feathering
arrows, he asked the other man to lower him from the top of the cliff
to the nest. When they had come to the place, Coyote asked the other
man to allow himself to be lowered and to throw the feathers down for him.
Coyote lowered him, asking if he had come to the young eagles. The reply
was, “Not yet.” A little later, the same question was repeated and the
answer this time was, “Yes.” Coyote then let the rope fall on the man
saying, “Cousin, she who was your wife will be mine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The man then sat with the young eagles. He asked what sort of weather
prevailed when their father returned. They replied that a “male” rain
fell.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c010'><sup>[60]</sup></a> Soon a “male” rain fell and the father of the young eagles flew back
in the rain. When he came where the man was sitting with the young
eagles, he asked who was there. The man replied that Coyote had lowered
him and that he was hovering his children for him. The male bird
told him he might remain there and flew off.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man then asked the young birds in what sort of weather their mother
came back. They said she returned when a “female” rain was falling.
Soon a “female” rain fell and the eagle's wife returned. She asked the
man who he was; he told her that Coyote had lowered him down there
and that he was staying with her children. Now she told him he might
remain there and departed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The male bird came back accompanied by a “male” rain. He brought
with him a water vessel made of turquoise and bade the man drink. He
drank and the water was not exhausted although the vessel of turquoise
was very small.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c010'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Accompanied by a “female” rain the female bird returned and perched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>nearby. She put down a horn vessel of boiled corn and invited the man to
eat it. It was a small vessel, but it was not empty when he had finished
his meal.</p>

<p class='c000'>She flew away again and after four days the eagle people all assembled.
They gave him an eagle shirt and instructed him to do as they did. He
put on the shirt and flew a little way with it. He put on one shirt after
another and flew farther and farther each time, four times. He was a
man but he became an eagle.</p>

      <div class='line in4'>“Where am I going?” he asked.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>“Where the black mirage is located at the center of the sky, I go up.</div>

      <div class='line in4'>“Between the two who sit on the white sky, I go up. Where the white weeds tower up, white on the sky at its center, I go up,” he sang.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>“Where the dark houses of the eagles project, I come,” he sang.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He lay down where there were no habitations. They asked him in
vain to come inside the building, for soon the person with a skull that kills
would come.</p>

<p class='c000'>Saying he would remain there, he refused, and lay down. In the night,
he heard the one with a skull that kills coming. He took up a stone and
hit him with it as he walked by and killed him. He also killed the bees
that had caused the eagles to die out by stinging them. He took the bees
from their nests and killed them all. He killed, too, the wasps that lived
in rocks, and all the yellow jackets. The tumble weeds, also, were killing
the eagles by rolling on them. He beat these weeds with a stick and
destroyed them.</p>

<p class='c000'>He inquired of an old eagle woman where others were living. She told
him of wood-rats which have many houses and bring back much material
when they go abroad. He went where cactus was standing and when
night came, lay down to sleep. He heard the sound of people shouting
toward the east. They were saying, “Down here.” They were chasing
an insect called <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">agetdlic</span></i>. He killed it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>The stars were people and were coming to get arrows. Those who were
running after <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">agetdlic</span></i> jumped over his body one by one as they reached it.
The last one who was running succeeded in jumping over the body but fell
back on it.</p>

<p class='c000'>They removed the skin, cut up meat, tied it up, and put it on the man's
back for him to carry. They warned him against looking back. He
started away with it and carried it until he came to the top of a hill.
Wondering why he had been told not to look back, he did so and fell over
backward. He went to the camp of the eagles and told them his load was
on the hill. They went to get the load and brought it to the camp. There
was a big pile of the meat which they brought back. “This was what he
meant,” they said. It was sunset by the time they brought the meat back.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The man is a good helper,” they said. “He has killed for us all those
who used to kill us.” The man then said he was going home, and the eagle
people told him he might do so. They told him, though, that if he was
afraid four times to fly down, that he could not go down. He was afraid
the fourth time and came back saying that he would start home again on
the fourth day.</p>

<p class='c000'>They went with him to the place where the trail came up. He was
afraid three times, but when it was to be the fourth time he flew down.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where the white mirage is located in the center of the sky he rested;
where the yellow house stands, resting in its shadow he sat down.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The blue house, standing at the center of the sky; resting in the shade
he sat down again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The black house, standing at the center of the sky; resting in its shade
he sat down again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>From there he flew down and lit on the earth. He alighted on a tree
near which sat the Coyote who had lowered him. He was saying he would
shoot the eagle there and get feathers to fix his arrow's. When Coyote
tried to steal up close under him the eagle flew away to his house and became
a man again. Those, who used to be his children had been renamed, “They
grew up by eating the neck.” Coyote had punched their eyes out. “He
did it with an awl,” they told their father.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he came back from hunting, his two children had been all right.
He heard him bring his load as he came back. He was saying, “Raised-with-neck-meat,
come and meet me.” “Do not go there,” he told his sons.
Coyote kept shouting as he came. He brought the load there and threw it
down. He called out. “Good, Cousin. You have come back? I took
good care of your children.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The man who had been with the eagles then told his wife to put four
stones on the fire. She put them on the fire to heat. She put one here and
one here. “Put two of the stones in your mouth and put your feet on these
two,” he told Coyote. Coyote did as he was told to, but ran only a little
way before his tail fell out. His wife had an ill odor from being with Coyote.
He beat among Coyote's children with a stick.</p>

<p class='c000'>He did not like living on the earth. He placed eagle plumes in a row
which multiplied fourfold. With the aid of these the man became an eagle.
The people living here came to have medicinemen with power from eagles.
He was a man but became an eagle and is now in the sky above.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>A man (Naiyenezgani) was living alone. He brought wood there and
built a fire. He danced on rawhide against white men and then went to
war. He came where the white people were and killed a white woman.
He raised up her skirt with a stick and Gila monster was there. “Let
that be your name,” he said and Gila Monster was called <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">łenellai</span></i>. The two
of them started back and came to a mountain called Bitcilł'ehe. From
there they went back and came to a place called Tsitena'a. A porcupine
was there and one of the men said, “My cousin, a porcupine lies here.”
They killed it and buried it in the ashes of the fire. At midnight he uncovered
it, but Naiyenezgani did not eat of it, only his partner. “My
cousin, it tastes like red peppers, taste it,” he said. They lay down again
and went to sleep. The next morning there were traces where the one who
had eaten had crawled into the water as a snake. Naiyenezgani went back
from there and in the yellow light of evening came back to Tatakawa,<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c010'><sup>[63]</sup></a> saying,
“Since early this morning I came from Tsitena'a.” When all the people
had come together they asked, “What place is called that?” “Big-hawk-old-man
says he has been all over earth and seen everything.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c010'><sup>[64]</sup></a> Send for
him,” they said. When he was summoned, he came walking with his cane
and sat down. “You are accustomed to say you have seen every place
on earth. A man says he has come from Tsitena'a since early this morning,”
they told him. “Well, it is not near. I flew from there in ten days
and when I came here the yellow light of sunset was over the earth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Naiyenezgani then said, “He stayed with me last night and he ate
something. It seems he turned into a snake and crawled in the river.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All the Eagle people, Black Whirlwind, the Sun, the Moon, and the Gan
people all started toward Tsitena'a. When they came there, in the presence
of the Sun and Moon, Black Gan rolled a turquoise hoop into the water.
The water of the river rose up so much. Then Ganłbaiye rolled a hoop of
<i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">bacinϵ</span></i> into the water. Next Gan with his face half covered rolled a hoop
of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">tsϵłtcϵϵ</span></i> in the water and the river was lifted up so much (about a yard).
Finally, Ganłtci' rolled a hoop of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">yołgai</span></i> and the water was high enough
above the river bed that a man could walk under it.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c010'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>They all entered the bed of the river and followed the man who had
turned into a snake. They finally overtook him. There was a snake on
the other side which they concluded was the one who had been a man.
A turquoise hoop was rolled toward him and it jumped over his neck. From
the neck up he took on the appearance of a man. A hoop of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">bacinϵ</span></i> was next
rolled and it fell to the waist. Next a loop of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">tcϵłtcϵϵ</span></i> was rolled which
jumped on the man and fell to the hips, above which he took the form of a
man. Finally a hoop of <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">yołgai</span></i> was rolled, and his entire body became
human. Then they took him by the hand and led him back. They danced
for him twelve nights and he was restored as a man. During the twelve
nights, no one was allowed to sleep, but someone did fall asleep. The one
who had turned into a snake began to sing, “I am going up. I am going
up where the sky comes together,” he said as he sang. He was no longer
seen where he had been standing. The man had a sister who began to sing.
“Truly, I am going where it is called, mesquites-come-together.” She was
no longer where she had been standing.</p>

<p class='c000'>She is the one who crawls around here in the summertime. The female
lives below; the male lives above.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c010'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It was here the Indians secured the supernatural power. Naiyenezgani
alone had the <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">najonc</span></i> poles. He alone played with them. There were two

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>The Hunter who secured the Bear Ceremony</span>.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c010'><sup>[67]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A man was out hunting when there was snow on the ground. As he
walked along a hillside he slipped and fell off. Below was a bear's den and
he fell right into it. When the female bear discovered him she jumped
around and said, “Wau, wau, wau, wau.” “Please do not act like that,
grandmother,” he said. “It seems I fell in here.” He remained there
four days without anything to eat. “Are you not hungry?” the bear
asked. “I am hungry,” he replied, “but what is there I can eat?” She
shook herself and cactus fruit rained down from her. After a second period
of fasting, the same question was asked and the same reply given. When
the bear shook herself, juniper berries fell. The third time it was white
oak acorns, and the fourth time, manzanita berries.</p>

<p class='c000'>After that she said there were two persons living across the valley and
that they would go there to visit. She also said the visit would be dangerous,
for she had in mind bears and a bear's camp. The bear told the man
to remain between her hind legs during the period of danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they entered the bear's house and the hosts became aware of the
man's presence, they became aroused and growled, “Wau, wau, wau.”
The man remained between the hind legs of his companion who reached
around with her front legs and defended him. “He has been with me a
long time and he is our friend,” she said to the others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next they all went to a camp where there were three bears and there
again the same things happened and the same expressions were used.
From there they went with him to a camp where there were four bears. He
was protected at that camp as on the former occasions and was introduced
as a friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accompanied by the bears, he went back to the camp at which he had
first arrived. He had been gone a year. He came back to his own people.
From this man there came to be bear songs and medicinemen with bear
power.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Owl was a person. He lived by eating people, carrying off the small
children in a large burden basket. He had a wife to whom he brought
them, saying to her, “Boil them.” When they were cooked he ate them.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were some people who were living in a large house made of white
cactus. Owl poked a pole in after them. The people inside held on to the
pole. Owl pulled on it and the people held to it. They let go suddenly and
Owl fell over backwards. He took two children on his back and carried
them away toward the camp. He put the basket down with the children
in it and went some distance away to urinate. While he was gone, the
children put a large stone in the basket and defiled it. Owl started away
again with his load, but when he passed under the limb of a tree the children
caught hold of it. They turned into downy feathers and were blown away
by the wind. “Boys, downy feathers are being blown about over there,”
he said. They had been persons, but now they were downy feathers. Owl
brought his load to the house for his wife. She took a knife and tried to
cut across the stone with it. “It is a stone,” she said. He took it to his
son-in-law. “It is a stone with manure on it,” he said. “That is its gall,”

this point.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Long ago, Coyote was told that the people were dying. He tied together
a hairbrush, a wooden skin-dresser, and a stone pestle, and threw them in
the water. “If these float let them come back to life,” he said. They
sank and, therefore, the dead did not come back.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c010'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Snow fell. It rained down in the form of flour. This same Coyote said,
“I chewed ice,” and it became ice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Also the horns of deer were tallow. Coyote again said, “I chew bones.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Coyote became ill. He had a handsome daughter. When he became
ill, he told his wife to throw him away. He said their daughter was to be
given to a man with a panther-skin quiver on his back who would come to
play <i><span lang="apw" xml:lang="apw">najonc</span></i>. This man, he said, would also have a prairie-dog in his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Coyote was dead his wife gave the daughter to the man described
by Coyote and he married her. It was Coyote himself, who married his
own daughter. He had her hunt his lice. On the back of his head was a
large wart. He told her that the lice always stay on this side, indicating
a portion of his head remote from the wart. While she was looking for
his lice, her husband fell asleep. Wondering why he always spoke as he did,
she looked on the back of his head. There was a wart there. She slipped
his head off her lap while he was asleep and going to her mother told her
that the man was her father; that he had a wart on the back of his head.
She picked up a large stone and was about to strike him on the crown of his
head when he saw her shadow. He jumped, ran out, and trotted off toward
the east. Whenever he came where there were camps people reviled him
as the man who had his own daughter for his wife. They heard him saying
“ci, ci, ci.” They referred to him as the scabby one and hit him. He
cried “wai” and turned from human form into a coyote.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coyote was driving some mules. He smothered five of the mules.
He wondered what smothered them. “Hurry,” he said, “skin their
throats. This place will be called Coyote Springs,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>When coyotes were people they all drank whiskey and ran about everywhere
shouting. When they became coyotes, they barked.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
